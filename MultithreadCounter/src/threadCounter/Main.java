/*

Implement a parallel array sum, and compare performance with single thread sum. 
This is not an easy assignment â€“ just do as much as you can and turn in what you have for partial credit.

Make an array of 200 million random numbers between 1 and 10. 
Compute the sum in parallel using multiple threads. 
Then compute the sum with only one thread, and display the sum and times for both cases.
